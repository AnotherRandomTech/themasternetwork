The masternetwork is a project that allows computer to execute python scripts for developpers. The computer that execute the python script are paid in monero in exchange.

## How the masternetwork works ?
<p>
Some scripts, like scrapping algorithms required to be executed from multiple location. <br>
Developpers can send to our website their code, they define a number of repetition, a price per second of execution (in monero).<br>
They fill their account in monero by sending to their subadress some monero (a subadress is generated at the creation of the account).

<br>
<br>
On the other hand, you can get monero by executing python scripts of the developpers. 
You can see how to make your computer work for you <a href="/installation">here</a><br><br>
The python scripts will run in a docker container, so there is no risk that a malicious script access your computer data.

The monero collected will be credited in your account, then you will be able to trigger a transfer to your adress.

## Is the masternetwork live ?
<p>
Yeah ! We may have scalability issue in the future but for now it is working well !
