The masternetwork is a project that allows computer to execute python scripts for developpers. 

## How the masternetwork works ?
<p>
Developpers can drop their script on the platform and define a price per execution and the number of repetition. On the other hand, people that wants to earn money from their computing power can connect their computer to the network. They define a price from which they will execute the developper script. They will be paid this exact price (difference goes to the network developpment). 
</p>

## Is the masternetwork live ?
<p>
Actually, yes. <br><br>
But there is no payment for now, only one computer is running, for testing purpose.
